# Heart-Disease-Prediction

The repository holds my solution for the Heart Disease Prediction Kaggle competition held in March/April 2024. My code managed to take third place on the leaderboard with test dataset accuracy at the level of 0.86956. As a fresh machine learning enthusiast, with an aspiration for strong development in this field, I particularly enjoy taking part in this competition and taking my first steps in model creation and optimization.
